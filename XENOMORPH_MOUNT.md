# ü¶æ Xenomorph Toolhead Mount Guide

Guide for mounting the PaWe i-print display on a Xenomorph toolhead.

---

## üìê Display Specifications

**ESP32-2424S012C with Case:**
- **Diameter:** 45.4mm (with case)
- **Thickness:** 11.2mm total (with case)
- **Display active area:** 28mm diameter (1.28" round LCD)
- **Mounting:** Case-dependent (check your specific case)

**Note:** These measurements are for the display WITH case installed.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Your display (45.4mm) is **LARGER** than BTT KNOMI (40mm). Standard KNOMI mounts will NOT fit without modification!

---

## üîç Xenomorph Toolhead Information

The **Xenomorph** is a toolhead conversion for Voron printers that typically includes:
- Extruder mount
- Hotend mount
- Part cooling ducts
- Optional display mount (for BTT KNOMI)

**Original KNOMI mount location:** Front center of toolhead

---

## üéØ Mounting Options

### Option 1: BTT KNOMI Mount Adapter

The Xenomorph likely has a mount designed for BTT KNOMI. You'll need an adapter.

**BTT KNOMI dimensions:**
- Diameter: ~40mm
- Mounting: 2x M3 screws on sides

**Your display with case:**
- Diameter: 45.4mm (larger than KNOMI!)
- Thickness: 11.2mm

**Adapter options:**
- **Option A:** Replace KNOMI mount entirely with larger mount
- **Option B:** Design adapter that extends KNOMI mount
- Access to USB-C port on bottom/back

### Option 2: Custom Mount Design

**Design requirements:**
- **Inner diameter:** 45.5-46mm (snug fit for your cased display)
- **Depth:** 12mm minimum (11.2mm display + clearance)
- **Retention:** Depends on your case (friction fit, clips, or screws)
- **Cable access:** Bottom/back cutout for USB-C cable
- **Viewing angle:** Slight tilt (10-15¬∞) for better visibility

## üõ†Ô∏è DIY Mount Design (FreeCAD/Fusion360)

### Base Measurements

```
Display diameter: 45.4mm (with case)
Display thickness: 11.2mm (with case)

Mount design:
Inner ring: 45.5-46mm diameter (snug fit for cased display)
Depth: 12-13mm (11.2mm display + clearance)
Wall thickness: 2.5-3mm
Bottom/back cutout: 15mm x 8mm (USB-C access)
Mounting: Depends on Xenomorph mount (M3 screws or custom)

Note: Your display is LARGER than KNOMI (45.4mm vs 40mm)
```

### Features to Include

1. **Friction fit ring** - Holds display securely
2. **Cable channel** - Routes USB cable to toolhead
3. **Viewing angle** - 10-15¬∞ tilt
4. **Snap clips** - Easy removal for maintenance
5. **Ventilation** - Small slots for heat dissipation

## üì¶ Where to Find Xenomorph Files

### Official Sources

1. **Voron Design GitHub**
   - https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers
   - Look for Xenomorph in `/printer_mods/`

2. **Printables/Thingiverse**
   - Search: "Xenomorph toolhead"
   - Search: "Xenomorph KNOMI mount"

3. **Voron Discord**
   - #voron_user_mods channel
   - Ask for Xenomorph + KNOMI mount files

---

## üîß Modification Steps

### 1. Find Original KNOMI Mount

```bash
# Example file structure
Xenomorph/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ toolhead_main.stl
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knomi_mount.stl          ‚Üê This is what you need
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cable_cover.stl
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assembly_guide.pdf
```

### 2. Measure KNOMI Mount

- Import `knomi_mount.stl` into CAD software
- Measure mounting hole spacing
- Measure inner diameter
- Note attachment method (screws, clips, etc.)

### 3. Design Adapter

**Option A: Modify existing mount**
```
1. Open knomi_mount.stl in FreeCAD/Fusion360
2. Reduce inner diameter from 40mm to 35.5mm
3. Adjust depth to 8mm
4. Add USB-C cutout at bottom
5. Export as STL
```

**Option B: Create insert ring**
```
1. Design ring: 40mm OD, 35.5mm ID, 8mm height
2. Add tabs to clip into KNOMI mount
3. Add USB-C cutout
4. Print in flexible filament (TPU) for friction fit
```

---

## üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printing Recommendations

### Material
- **PLA/PETG:** Rigid mount
- **TPU:** Flexible insert (better grip)
- **ABS:** Heat resistant (if near hotend)

### Settings
```
Layer height: 0.2mm
Infill: 30-50%
Walls: 3-4 perimeters
Supports: Minimal (design for no supports)
Orientation: Print upright for strength
```

---

## üîå Wiring Considerations

### Cable Routing

1. **USB-C cable** exits bottom of display
2. Route along toolhead to umbilical
3. Use cable clips to secure
4. Leave slack for toolhead movement

### Cable Length

- **Minimum:** 50cm (for cable chain)
- **Recommended:** 1m (with slack)
- **Type:** USB-C to USB-A (for Raspberry Pi)

### Power Options

**Option 1: USB from Pi**
- Simple, no extra wiring
- 5V/500mA from USB port
- Plug into Pi USB port

**Option 2: Dedicated 5V supply**
- More reliable power
- Connect to printer 5V rail
- Use buck converter if needed

## üìè Quick Adapter Design

### Simple Friction-Fit Ring

**FreeCAD/OpenSCAD code:**

```openscad
// ESP32-2424S012C with case - adapter ring
// Display: 45.4mm diameter x 11.2mm thick

difference() {
    // Outer ring (adjust to match your Xenomorph mount)
    cylinder(h=12, d=52, $fn=100);  // Outer diameter depends on mount
    
    // Inner ring (holds cased display)
    translate([0, 0, -1])
    cylinder(h=14, d=45.5, $fn=100);  // 45.5mm for snug fit
    
    // USB-C cutout (adjust position based on your case)
    translate([-7.5, -26, -1])
    cube([15, 10, 14]);
}

// Mounting tabs (adjust based on Xenomorph mount)
// Note: Your display is larger than KNOMI, may need custom mount
for (angle = [0, 180]) {
    rotate([0, 0, angle])
    translate([23, 0, 6])
    cube([4, 2, 12], center=true);
}
```

## üé® Visual Design Ideas

### LED Ring Integration
- Add WS2812B LED ring around display
- 16-24 LEDs in 40mm ring
- Status indication (heating, printing, etc.)

### Protective Cover
- Clear acrylic or PETG cover
- Protects display from debris
- Snap-on design

- [ ] Check USB-C cable access
- [ ] Verify viewing angle
- [ ] Install on Xenomorph toolhead
- [ ] Route USB cable to Pi
- [ ] Secure cable with clips
