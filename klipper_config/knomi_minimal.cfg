# Simple status macro - safe to use
[gcode_macro PAWE_STATUS]
gcode:
  {% set msg = params.MSG|default("Status Update") %}
  M117 {msg}
  RESPOND MSG="{msg}"

# Optional: Track homing state (only if you want this feature)
# Uncomment these lines if you need homing tracking:
#
# [gcode_macro HomeSetVar]
# variable_homing: False
# gcode:
#   # This macro just stores a variable, safe to have

# Optional: Track bed leveling state (only if you want this feature)
# Uncomment these lines if you need leveling tracking:
#
# [gcode_macro BedLevelVar]
# variable_leveling: False
# gcode:
#   # This macro just stores a variable, safe to have

# That's it! Your PaWe i-print display will work via the Klipper API
# without needing any macro overrides.
